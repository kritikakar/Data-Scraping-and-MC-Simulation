    "1. Write a function called `mcsim(df,N,alpha)` which takes as inputs the `Pandas` dataframe `df` you have scraped, the number `N` of Monte Carlo simulations you require, and the confidence level `alpha`. The function should resample the data `N` times, fit a linear model to each new dataset, and store the estimates of intercept and slope. The function should then return a `Pandas` dataframe output with two columns, 'Intercept' and 'Slope', with the rows being the `N` estimates of the parameters. \n",

    "*Bootstrapping resamples a dataset to create many simulated sample datasets, which is asymptotically more accurate than using sample variance and assuming normality for calculating standard errors and confidence intervals.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The function `mcsim` conducts a non-parametric bootstrap N times and generates a standard normal distribution to standardise the independent variable (Monte Carlo simulation). It then performs a regression and stores the intercepts and slopes. The histograms show the distribution of the slope and intercept for different values of N and the confidence intervals of both the original dataset and the bootstrap.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The confidence intervals from the bootstrap are much wider than those from the original dataset for all N and alpha. This is because bootstrap intervals account for the sampling variability of the data. Moreover, due to resampling, there is more uncertainty with respect to estimates and there may be more extreme values. The confidence intervals from the original data roughly lie in the centre of the distribution of the bootstrap samples.*\n"
